# (WIP) Just Another D&D Character Manager

![](./preview.gif)

A customizable D&D character manager.

* Add new abilities, skills, senses, etc. Automatically calculate values by linking them to each other.
* Track your resources. Create counters (checkboxes or number boxes with +/- buttons) and link their max value to your abilities, skills, proficiency or anything else.
* Create features that increase you saves/abilities/hit points/etc. by a set amount or by the value of another stat.
* Roll dice.

Supports importing spells from JSON. Support for importing other items is planned.
